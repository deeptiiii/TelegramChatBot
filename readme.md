## How to Use the Chat Bot:-

## For now it can answer only some questions which I will mention below:-
### Please note that it's case sensitive for now :unamused:<br>
+ Hey 
+ Hello
+ bot
+ Who are you?
+ What can you do?
+ Anything else exept these will be replied by:`idk`


#### I have Deployed it on the cloud, the cloud I chose for this purpose is `pythonanywhere.com` so that it can run 24/7. :wink:<br>

### You are good to go!!
